# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

## May need to use an OMAP see yaml.org/type/omap.html

  id: 1
  title: Test Doc 1

  body: '#Test Body'
