# Courses Overview
Courses are one of the primary means of interacting within the CIRTL Network Community. Courses hosted in the CIRTL Network maintain the standard of the community and cover the fundamental outcomes that the CIRTL Network strive to achieve.

Courses exist in a number of formats. They can be hosted as a cross-Network course in which any member of the CIRTL Network may apply for, or a Local course which is hosted by member Institutions.
