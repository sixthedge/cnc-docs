# Managing Courses and Proposals
> Managing courses and course proposals are accomplished via 'Course Admin' tab in the sub-navigation menu. This will appear for CIRTL Central and Institution leaders.

If you are part of CIRTL Central or you are an Institution leader you will see `Course Admin` in the sub-nav bar while in the courses sections. This is where you will manage course proposals and reviews for your given context, CIRTL Central will see cross-Network proposals and Institution Leaders will see local courses from their institution.

It is important to understand the [Approval Process](/1.0.0/courses/creating-courses#approval-process) while in the 'Course Admin' section as this will determine where the proposals and courses will appear and what it means.

There are also three sub-sections within the `Course Admin` section, [Current](#current), [Upcoming](#upcoming) and [Proposed](#proposed).

## Current
The current tab will show you all published courses that are part of the current running semester.

## Upcoming
The upcoming tab will show all published courses that are part of any upcoming semesters.

## Proposed
The proposed tab will display proposals that are still undergoing the approval process. From this page, you can click on any of the items in any list to go to the [Proposal Review](#proposal-review).

There are 3 lists that contain proposals in their various states within the approval process, [Pending List](#pending-list), [Revision Pending List](#revision-pending-list) and [Reviewing List](#reviewing-list).

### Pending List
The pending list will display all course proposals that have been submitted for the first time to be reviewed. Any proposal at this point has had all the required fields filled out. Once an action is taken on the pending proposal, it will be sent back to the author and admins of the proposal to take the necessary actions to proceed through the [Approval Process](/1.0.0/courses/creating-courses#approval-process).

### Revision Pending List
The Revision Pending list is similar to the [Pending List](#pending-list) in that the proposal is ready to be reviewed again. Proposals in this state have been previously submitted, but required revisions on the part of the creator or administrators. Similar to how feedback was given during the reviewing of the proposal, comments from the proposals administrators can be given about the changes they made to address the feedback.

### Reviewing List
The reviewing list has proposals that are currently being revised by their creators. Although this means no actions are required for the proposal on part of CIRTL Central or Institution leaders, you can still access the [Proposal Review](#proposal-review) page and select the list of actions if need be to approve or deny the proposal outright.

## Proposal Review
> The proposal review is where you can view all the information about the corresponding proposal take action to approve, deny or require revisions.

After reviewing the information about the proposal, there are some areas that require attention: 

The 'Proposed Semester' is a drop-down that contains any semesters that have been selected by the proposal creators. By selecting the semester, you are approving them for their requested semesters.

The feedback text area where you can add additional comments about proposals that will be denied or require revisions.

The last part of the review is to either Approve, Deny or Require Revision. This will set the state of the proposal appropriately.

## Semester Deadline
> The semester deadline tab is only accessible by CIRTL Central where they can create, update, or remove semesters from the system.

To add a semester, click the 'Add Semester' button at the top. This will bring up the creation fields. The 'Term' field is text and is combined with the 'Year' number input to create the 'Term-Year'. The start and end dates will be used to determine what semesters are active and upcoming. The registration start and end will be used for courses registration dates that associate with that semester.
