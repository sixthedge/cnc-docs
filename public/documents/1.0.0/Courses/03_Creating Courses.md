# Creating courses within the CIRTL Network

> Creating courses in the CIRTL Network Community is a process that involves both members and affiliates of the CIRTL Network, as well as CIRTL Central or Institution Leaders.

To begin the creation process, first find the panel on either Upcoming Courses or My Courses that have links to the Course Wizard. The Course Wizard is how you create and edit your proposals and courses.

## Approval Process
The approval process is the system that allows for members to generate proposals for courses they want hosted through the CIRTL Network. For any cross-Network course, CIRTL Central will be reviewing the proposals, and for local courses, Institution leaders will be reviewing. 

<small>_*See [Course States](/1.0.0/references/course-states) for a detail listing of each state._</small>

When you start the wizard, your proposal is automatically created as a draft. This is gives you the ability to revisit the proposal if you do not have all of the information available at that time. 

<small>_*See [Course Wizard](#course-wizard) about the steps of the course proposal process._</small>

Once you have successfully submitted your proposal, it is put into a pending state. At this point, the proposal will be reviewed and take one of three actions: approve, review or reject.

Rejected proposals will no longer be able to be submitted.

Review means that there was some issues with the proposals that need to be amended. When the proposal is sent back for review, it may contain feedback about the changes required. Once the changes are made re-submitting, the proposal will sent back to repeat the process.

Approved proposals are given the green light and sent back to the course administrators to fully complete the logistics of the course. 

Proposals that have included logistics can be published by the course administrators, allowing for registration to begin on the course via the 'Course' page in the 'About' tab.

## Course Wizard

The course wizard is the tool you will use as you work through your proposal. You can re-enter the wizard to make edits at any time or if the proposal has yet to be submitted, then click the course link in My Courses will redirect to the wizard.

The wizard separates the proposal process into steps that can be saved as you go. When you enter the wizard, the steps will be displayed at the top and can be clicked to navigate around the wizard. Some steps may be locked based on the state of the proposal.

Not every field will need to be filled out to submit the proposal. Only the fields that require validation are needed for the submission, which will display error text if the validations are not met. You can proceed to any step even without having the validated fields completed in case you do not have the information at that time.

At the bottom of every step or in the header are action to navigate throughout the form as well. If the proposal has yet to be submitted, it will also contain a button for deleting the proposal.

**Information within these steps may vary depending on if the course you are proposing is a cross-Network or local.**

### 1. Course Details
Course details contains the basic information about the course.

The 'Course Details' step is split into 4 sub-steps that can be saved individually. The first sub-step is expanded when you start the draft, but any step can be expanded by clicking on them. If the sub-step is 'In-Progress', it does not contain all of the required fields to be considered complete.

### 2. Learning Outcomes
The learning outcomes step contains the potential learning outcomes that your course is looking to target. Depending on what level you selected on Course Details step, it may have already expanded the corresponding list, but it is possible to add any learning outcome.

Once a learning outcome is selected, a text area will display requiring a description about how you are going to address this learning outcome.

### 3. Assessments
The assessments step is where you will select what assessments you will be using for this course. It may have a few sections depending on what is selected. The first is the assessment setup where you can select if you want a Post-assessment or Pre & Post assessments, along with the type of assessments you will be using.

Depending on if you have just a Post-assessment or both Pre & Post it will have fields below that allow you to enter the name and optional URL for each assessment.

### 4. Logistics
Logistics step is how you add meetings to your course. This step is initially locked and becomes unlocked once your proposal is approved by the appropriate group.

There are three parts to the logistics step: Start & End dates, Registration deadline, and Meetings.

The start and end dates are the official date range of the course. The end date will be used to determine if a course has been concluded, while the start date limits which dates you can set meetings on for the course.

The registration date of the course is used if the course is not part of a semester. If a semester is selected, the registration date range is determined by the semester.

Meetings are instances of when the course will be meeting. Meetings can be a single occurrence, or by selecting 'Repeat Meeting', you can set the meetings over a period of time. Use the Summary along with modifying the fields to get a good idea of what meetings will be auto-generated. You can also add multiple meetings which can repeat in their own schedule for more flexibility.

### 5. Confirmation
The confirmation step gives you an overview of what your course or proposal looks like. This is the page where you can submit your initial or completed proposal, as well as any edits to your course.

If your proposal is missing any required fields, they will be marked so you can go back.
