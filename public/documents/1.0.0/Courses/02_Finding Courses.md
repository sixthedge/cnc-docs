The created section is where course authors, instructors, and administrators can view their active courses, as well as any proposals they currently have within the system.

Courses and proposals have been categorized into 4 separate lists based on their state. Proposals within these lists may require certain actions to further the approval process and have information in the footer to help you determine what actions are required.

- **Drafts**: _Proposals undergoing the approval process_
  - **__Draft has not been submitted__**: Proposal form has not been completed or submitted for review.
  - **__Waiting for CIRTL review__**: Proposal has been submitted and is pending review.
  - **__Waiting for you to make revisions__**: Proposal has been reviewed and requires some revisions.

- **Approved**: _Proposals that have been approved but require further instruction_
  - **__Set your logistics to complete proposal__**: Proposal has review and approved, now the proposal needs logistics to be finalized.
  - **__Waiting to be published__**: Proposal has fully completed and is ready to be published.

- **Published**: _Courses that are currently active_
  - **__Total Students__**: Number of students approved, pending or rejected on the roster.
  - **__Students Dropped__**: Number of students of rejected students.

  - **__Proposal has been cancelled__**: The course or proposal has been cancelled and is inactive.

### Attending
The attending section is where any member can see courses in which they are on the roster for.

## Course Archive
> Course Archive is where you can find courses that have been published and are now past their end date, as well as currently running courses.

Like the upcoming page, the archive page lists only published courses. There are two lists on this page, currently active and past. 

Currently active courses appear here as to not clutter the upcoming page for those looking for courses to participate in because more than likely their registration deadline has past. 

Past courses are also listed to allow members to retrieve any information about courses that they may have participated in or want to know more about that have already ended.
