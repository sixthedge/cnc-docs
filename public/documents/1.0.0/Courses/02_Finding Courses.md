There are two sub-sections in My Courses that can be accessed via the tabs 'Created' and 'Attending'.

### Created
<small>_*Default section when navigating to My Courses_</small>

The created section is where course authors, instructors, and administrators can view their active courses, as well as any proposals they currently have within the system.

Courses and proposals have been categorized into 4 separate lists based on their state. Proposals within these lists may require certain actions to further the approval process and have information in the footer to help you determine what is required.

- **Drafts**: _Proposals undergoing the approval process_
  - Have yet to be submitted
  - Under CIRTL Central review
  - Require revisions by administrators

- **Approved**: _Proposals that have been approved but require further instruction_
  - Approved and need logistics
  - Completed and need to be published

- **Published**: _Courses that are currently active_
  - Completed **AND** published

- **Rejected/Canceled**: _Proposals or courses that have been made inactive_
  - Rejected by CIRTL Central
  - Canceled by administrators or CIRTL Central

### Attending
The attending section is where any member can see courses that they are actively registered user for or are administering.


## Course Archive
> Course Archive is where you can find courses that have been published and are now past their end date, as well as currently running courses.

Like the upcoming page, the archive page lists only published courses. There are two lists on this page, currently active and past. Currently active courses appear here as to not clutter the upcoming page for those looking for courses to participate in. Past courses are also listed to allow members to retrieve any information about courses that they may have participated in or want to know more about that have already ended.
