# Member Profile
Every member of the CIRTL Network Commons has a profile that displays an array of information. There are a number of ways to reach a member profile including your own.

To reach your own profile simply click on the avatar image on the right-most link in the main navigation bar or the 'View Profile' button from your dashboard.

Any member profile can be viewed and will display the members biography, recent activity they are involved in as well as their institution, discipline and interests.

## Editing Your Profile
To edit your own profile or account information first navigate to your own member profile page. In the header is the button `Edit Profile` to begin editing your profile. When you start editing your profile you will be at the [Profile Information](#profile-information) page. You may also update or add any social networks or include a picture on the left hand column.

If at any point you want to save your profile you can use the `Update Profile` button at the bottom of the page or `Save and Exit` in the header.
